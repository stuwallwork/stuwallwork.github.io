title: "Hosting on Github"
---

I have chosen to host this site on github, which among other things enables you to use R and R Markdown from within R Studio to produce the content you see here.  Set up was straight forward enough, below are some of the useful things I learned and links I used during set up.
---------
###Useful sites for initial set up

Configuring your github account and R Studio folders to host your R Markdown as html pages is easy when you know how, the links below should help with that.

Setting up Github and R Studio to host your R Markdown site on github itself [tutorial](http://nickstrayer.me/RMarkdown_Sites_tutorial/ "Hosting on git tutorial")

R Markdown by R Studio has a useful [page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html "R Markdown - R Studio") 


###Commiting updates to github

> _The order of actions required is, save all files, render the site, review and commit changes, push commited changes._

1. rmarkdown::render_site()  
*Creates an html file from each rmd file in the directory, a _ at the strart of a filename will exclude that file from this process.*

2. Commit this change to github: On the Git menu click Diff and review all changes, then commit.
*Note: by default this commits to the master, but as things get more complex it is possible to commit to a branch and then review on github before merging into the master *

3. Push the commited changes to the master (or branch) using the green up arrow.
