##Commiting updates to github

> rmarkdown::render_site()  

    *Creates an html file from each rmd file in the directory, a _ at the strart of a filename will exclude that file from this process.*

> Commit this change to github: On the Git menu click Diff and review all changes, then commit.

    *(by default this commits to the master, but as things get more complex it is possible to commit to a branch and then review on github before merging into the master)*

> Push the commited changes to the master (or branch) using the green up arrow.

    *So the order of actions required is, save all files, render the site, review and commit changes, push commited changes.*
