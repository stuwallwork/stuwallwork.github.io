[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

##Commiting updates to github

> rmarkdown::render_site()  

    *Creates an html file from each rmd file in the directory, a _ at the strart of a filename will exclude that file from this process.*

> Commit this change to github: On the Git menu click Diff and review all changes, then commit.

    *(by default this commits to the master, but as things get more complex it is possible to commit to a branch and then review on github before merging into the master)*

> Push the commited changes to the master (or branch) using the green up arrow.

    *So the order of events is, save all files, render the site, review and commit changes, push commited changes.*
