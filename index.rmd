__This site contins details of some of the functionlaty and useful links I encountered when first installing and beginning to use R.__

[R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) is the IDE (Integreated Development Environment) that I am using to explore some of the basics of [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), and R Markdown.

[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) is a markup language that can be used in R Studio to create documentation that can then be presented in multiple formats, such as html in the case of this website. Here is a useful [Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

[Github](https://github.com) seems to be a good way to host the content created using R and R Markdown.  It is great for version control and collaborative projects, and in this case was a relatively simple (several hours but not days) way to get a website up and running that is integreated with R Studio.
