+ Library  
+ Objects and Variables  
+ Functions  
+ Examine imported data  
+ Save and load workspace  
+ Logical operators  
+ Subsets  
+ Export data  


###Library

- library()
      + *views available packages*

- search()
      + *see what packages are loaded*

- library('car')
      + *loads the car package*

- install.packages('stringdist')
      + *installs a new package stringdist*


###Objects and Variables

 - x <- 1 
      + *assign the value 1 to variable x*
 
 - ls()
      + *list objects in the workspace*
 
 - rm(x)
      + *Delete (remove) variable x from the workspace*
 
 - data&newcol <- ifelse(data&existingcolumn < 10 ,"small","large")
      + *Adds a new column to the data table that is populated based on the condition specified
 
  - data<- transform(data,newcol = mean(oldcol),newcol2 = oldcol1-oldcol2,...)
    + *transform is another way to add additional columns to your data set.

###Functions

- sqrt()
      + *Resolves the square root of a number of variable*


###Importing Data

- getwd()
      + *returns the current working directory*

 - setwd('data sets')
      + *sets the working directory to the data sets folder within the existing working directory*
 
 - setwd('..')
      + *sets the working directory one level up from the existing working directory*
 
 - list.files('data sets')
      + *lists the files contained in the specified folder within the working directory*
 
 - read.csv()
 
      + *Reads.csv files using the utils (default) package*
 
 - read.table()
      + *other delimited formats using the utils (default) package*
   
 - read.WorksheetFromFile()
      + *.xls and .xlsx files using the XLConnect package*
    
    
###Examine imported data

**First name the data set: mydata<-read.csv('dataset.csv')**

- class(mydata)
      + *returns the class of the loaded data, usually this would be expected to be a data.frame.  This is a list of vectors or equal length (much like a table in excel)*

- dim(mydata)
      + *returns the number of rows and columns*

- names(mydata)
      + *returns the first 10 column names*

- str(mydata)
      + *returns details baout the first 5 columns*

###Save and load workspace

 - Saveing the workspace will save all objects in the workspace to a specified folder location:
 
    1. ls() 
     + *list the objects in the workspace that you are about to save*
    
    2. save.image(file='workspacename.RData') 
     + *save the workspace as an RData file this will save all objects listed above*
    
    3. rm(list=ls()) 
     + *remove all objects from the workspace*
    
 - Load a workspace (RData file) 
 
    1. Load('workspacename.RData') 
     + *Loads the workspace 'workspacename' from your current working directory*
    
    2. ls() 
     + *list objects in the workspace*

###Logical Operators
* '==' equal to  
* '!=' not equal to  
* '>' greater than  
* '<' less than  
* '>=' greater than or equal to   
* '<=' less than or equal to  
* '&' and  
* '|' or
  
  
### Subsets

* subset(dataset,subset = columnA > 100, select = c('columnA','columnB'))
      + *This will return the subsed of the dataset where the values in column A are greater than 100 and where the column names are columnA or columnB.*
      
* data <- subset(data, select = c('colA','colB')) 
      +  *Updates the data set to contain only the subset described.*
      
###Export Data

* write.csv(data, file = 'data.csv')

      + *exports the data set to data.csv in the current work space*
