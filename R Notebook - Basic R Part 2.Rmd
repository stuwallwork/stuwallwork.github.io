__Part 2 of these Basic R notebooks begins to investigate some of the simple statistics that can be carried out in R __



#Contents
+ Single variable stats
+ Tables and computations

###Single variable stats

*In the examples below 'var1' is a single variable defined from a data.frame (in other words var1 is one column of data) *

* var1
    + executing the variable name will return the list of values for var1 in the data set
    
* mean(var1)
    + returns the mean of the var1 as a single value

* sd(var1)
    + returns the standard deviation of the var1 as a single value
    
*summary(var1)
    + returns the min, 1st 2nd (median) and 3rd quartiles, the max and the mean.
    + the summary function will accept multiple variables and return the summary stats for each
    
###Tables and computations

* Single category table  
    + Table <- table(datacolumn)  
      *The table function will store the count of each unique item in the column*  
* Crosstabs  
    + crosstab <- table(datacol1,datacol2)  
    *creates a summary crosstab of the counts of 2 variables*   
    + 3vartable<- table(datacol1,datacol2,datacol3)  
    *creates the same crosstab with the first 2 variables and splits into sections based on the 3rd variable*
